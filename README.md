# HOW TO USE

Save your program in a text file.
If you have nix installed, type "nix-shell" on the terminal in the project root to derive a compatible development environment.
Then run "stack run olang" with the program file path as parameter.
Example: "stack run olang ./resources/example-programs/ackermann.olang"

# REQUIREMENTS

- EITHER already working and compatible ghc + stack installation OR (recommended) working nix >= 2.6 installation
- Linux operating system (Mac OS or Windows probably work too, but they were not tested)
